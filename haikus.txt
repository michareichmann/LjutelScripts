This strange blue plant
a collective of creatures
evolving in sync

A supernova
Emits beauty in darkness
Explosions of light

I got life advice
From a lonely physicist
It's all relative.

Winter, afraid of
Global warming
Ran to Antarctica

Dividing atoms
A promise for the future
Many people died.

Contract or expand?
Not the universe's size
But the human mind

This assay won’t work.
But it worked fine yesterday.
Another late night.

More than just atoms
we all are buzzing systems
of star dust and breath.

A vibration is
motion that cannot decide
which way it should go.

Some know the time by
looking at the sun. I can’t
make out the numbers

To some, solutions
are answers. To chemists they
are still all mixed up.

Humidity: when
you are looking for some air
but finding water.

Some past animals
became fossils while others
prefer to be oil.

Broke up molecules,
stuffed with atoms. Broke atoms,
stuffed with explosions.

Singularity
Starship spirals inwardly
Blue photons escape

carrion birds scatter
with each twitch
of reanimated flesh

lifeless planet
a scarecrow planted by
missing terraformers
